        <p>Reflection:<br>I don't know why I decided to convert the regular clock to the decimal clock. Decimal measurment of time was a proposal from the french revolution times for the change from our current system (Hours, Minutes, and Seconds) to ones sepeted by a factor of 100. Maybe I felt bored with myself. It is set in PDT, but does not change back to PST. I think I just did this to make it harder for myself.</p>
